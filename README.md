# stenography
This python script hides (encode) large amount of text in video files and then decode them as well

As for learning stenography and encoding/decoding large text files in the text, I started writing this Python script.

Requirements include:
-> OpenCV
-> PIL
-> moviepy
-> natsort
-> glob
-> numpy 
-> optparse

For simple demo, one can follow this youtube video to see how to make this script work with different system arguments
